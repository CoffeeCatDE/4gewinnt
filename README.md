## What is "Connect Four"?
Object: Connect four of your checkers in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same. 
A gameplay example (right), shows the first player starting Connect Four 
by dropping one of his/her yellow discs into the center column of an empty game board. 
The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, 
until the second player, with red discs, achieves a diagonal four in a row, and wins the game. 
For games where the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the games are a draw.
